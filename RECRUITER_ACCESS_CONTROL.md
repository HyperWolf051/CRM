# Recruiter Dashboard Access Control

## 🔒 Implementation Summary

The recruiter dashboard has been restricted to **demo accounts only** as requested. Here's what was implemented:

### ✅ Access Control Features

#### 1. **RecruiterProtectedRoute Component**
- **File**: `src/components/RecruiterProtectedRoute.jsx`
- **Function**: Checks if user has demo access before allowing entry to recruiter routes
- **Behavior**: 
  - Redirects non-demo users to main dashboard
  - Shows error toast notification explaining access restriction
  - Only allows users with `isDemo: true` or `email: 'demo@crm.com'`

#### 2. **Route Protection**
- **File**: `src/App.jsx`
- **Change**: Replaced `ProtectedRoute` with `RecruiterProtectedRoute` for `/app/recruiter` routes
- **Effect**: All recruiter routes now require demo access

#### 3. **Navigation Indicators**
- **File**: `src/components/CollapsibleSidebar.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - **Demo Badge**: Shows "Demo Access Only" banner in recruiter section
  - **Disabled Navigation**: Non-demo users see grayed-out recruiter nav items
  - **Visual Indicators**: "Demo Only" badges on restricted navigation items

#### 4. **Dashboard Promotion Banner**
- **File**: `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`
- **Feature**: Shows promotional banner for non-demo users
- **Content**: Encourages users to try recruiter features with demo credentials
- **Behavior**: Only visible to non-demo users, dismissible

### 🎯 Demo Account Access

#### **Allowed Demo Credentials:**
- **Email**: `demo@crm.com`
- **Password**: `demo123`

#### **How It Works:**
1. **Login Check**: System identifies demo users by email or `isDemo` flag
2. **Route Access**: Only demo users can access `/app/recruiter/*` routes
3. **Navigation**: Non-demo users see disabled recruiter navigation
4. **Feedback**: Clear messaging about demo-only access

### 🚀 User Experience

#### **For Demo Users:**
- ✅ Full access to recruiter dashboard
- ✅ All recruiter features available
- ✅ Normal navigation experience

#### **For Regular Users:**
- ❌ Cannot access recruiter routes (redirected to main dashboard)
- 🔒 See disabled recruiter navigation with "Demo Only" labels
- 📢 Promotional banner encouraging demo account usage
- 💬 Toast notification explaining access restriction

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation

#### **Access Control Logic:**
```javascript
const isDemoUser = user?.isDemo === true || user?.email === 'demo@crm.com';
```

#### **Route Structure:**
```
/app/recruiter/* → RecruiterProtectedRoute → RecruiterLayout
```

#### **Error Handling:**
- Graceful redirects for unauthorized access
- User-friendly error messages
- No broken states or 404 errors

### 📋 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login with `demo@crm.com` - should access recruiter dashboard
- [ ] Login with other credentials - should be blocked from recruiter routes
- [ ] Check navigation indicators for both user types
- [ ] Verify promotional banner shows for non-demo users
- [ ] Test direct URL access to recruiter routes
- [ ] Confirm toast notifications work properly

## 🎉 Result

The recruiter dashboard is now **exclusively available to demo account users**, providing a controlled way to showcase advanced recruitment features while maintaining access restrictions for regular users.
