# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the Add Post Job functionality in the CRM frontend application. The current job posting flow uses a modal/inline approach, but this enhancement will move it to a dedicated page with improved UX, accessibility, validation, and navigation. The new implementation will provide a comprehensive job posting experience with file uploads, preview functionality, and seamless integration with the existing Jobs list.
