# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a production-grade CRM (Customer Relationship Management) frontend application. The application will be a modern, intuitive, and scalable web interface designed with the polish and attention to detail of top-tier tech companies like IBM, Salesforce, and Intercom. The frontend will be built using React with Vite, styled with Tailwind CSS, and feature a comprehensive set of pages for managing contacts, deals, and user settings. The design will prioritize desktop/PC experience first with clean spacing, modern micro-interactions, and accessibility. The application is designed primarily for desktop use, with a separate native mobile app planned for future development.
