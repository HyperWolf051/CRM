## üöÄ Quick Installation (Recommended)

### Option 1: Automated Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd crm-pro

# Run the automated setup script
npm run setup
```

The setup script will:
1. ‚úÖ Check prerequisites
2. ‚úÖ Install frontend dependencies
3. ‚úÖ Install backend dependencies
4. ‚úÖ Create environment configuration
5. ‚úÖ Seed database with sample data
6. ‚úÖ Display login credentials

### Option 2: Start Development Environment
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
npm run dev:full
```

## üìã Manual Installation (Alternative)

If you prefer manual setup or the automated script doesn't work:

### Step 1: Clone and Install Frontend
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd crm-pro
npm install
```

### Step 2: Setup Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment
Create `backend/.env` file:
```env
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/crm_database
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### Step 4: Start MongoDB
Make sure MongoDB is running on your system:
```bash
# On Windows (if installed as service)
net start MongoDB

# On macOS (with Homebrew)
brew services start mongodb-community

# On Linux
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

### Step 5: Seed Database
```bash
cd backend
npm run seed
```

### Step 6: Start Servers

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. MongoDB Connection Error
```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017
```
**Solution**: Make sure MongoDB is running
```bash
# Check if MongoDB is running
ps aux | grep mongod

# Start MongoDB
sudo systemctl start mongod  # Linux
brew services start mongodb-community  # macOS
net start MongoDB  # Windows
```

#### 2. Port Already in Use
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```
**Solution**: Kill the process using the port
```bash
# Find process using port 3000
lsof -ti:3000

# Kill the process
kill -9 <process-id>
```

#### 3. Frontend Can't Connect to Backend
**Solution**: Check if backend is running and ports match
- Backend should be on port 3000
- Frontend should be on port 5173
- Check `vite.config.js` proxy configuration

#### 4. Database Seeding Fails
**Solution**: Clear database and try again
```bash
cd backend
# Connect to MongoDB and drop database
mongo
use crm_database
db.dropDatabase()
exit

# Run seed again
npm run seed
```

#### 5. JWT Token Issues
**Solution**: Clear browser storage
- Open browser DevTools (F12)
- Go to Application/Storage tab
- Clear localStorage and sessionStorage
- Refresh page and login again

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the logs**: Look at terminal output for error messages
2. **Verify prerequisites**: Ensure Node.js and MongoDB are properly installed
3. **Check ports**: Make sure ports 3000 and 5173 are available
4. **Clear cache**: Clear browser cache and localStorage
5. **Restart services**: Stop and restart both frontend and backend

## üìö Next Steps

5. **API Testing**: Use Postman to test API endpoints
6. **Mobile Testing**: Test responsive design on mobile devices

## üöÄ Production Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**: Set production values in `.env`
2. **Database**: Use MongoDB Atlas or production MongoDB instance
3. **Security**: Change JWT secret and enable HTTPS
4. **Build**: Run `npm run build` for frontend
5. **Process Manager**: Use PM2 for backend process management
6. **Reverse Proxy**: Use Nginx for load balancing and SSL
